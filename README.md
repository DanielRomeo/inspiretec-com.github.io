#### Questions & Notes
- I see on the home page hero section, "the ultimate in customer ...." this section, you intentionally added a `</b>` tag to seperate the lines. I have adopted this method for the `Information section` that i have added, this is the section that comes after the 'partners {brands}' section.

- In css `collaboration-section`, developer may have made a mistake by styling the class tag named `collaborate-section` instead of `collaboration-section`. I am not sure if this was done intentionally or not. Or if it is meant for other pages. This however, does not affect the styling of the Home page in any way.

- Havent yet worked on the mobile sections of the different sections before moving on to the next section because i still need the images...

- In css, in the button styling located `.design-feature-area .container .row .column-left .design-feature-text a{...}` The orange/yellow color does not exist in the given color-variables. So I used `orange` for now. 

- I have not added any button animations on hover, as I do not yet know what animations need to occur per button.
